# Ebusiness Hw2

The basic idea of the app is a geo-aware event or Message poster.
It retrieves posts from server and gather in a list. Users can add new posts.
By clicking on any post in the list, there will be a map showing where it is.

Originally I built a server to handle the data (create new post, or retrieve the post list),
but it requires a private network so I simplified it to retrieving a JSON from a html file.

This project is based on Google maps.
